  # List of JIRA Projects for which requests will be created: use `jira` for components that we use directly, `product` for
  # products we depend on but don't use directly (e.g. Keycloak or products for which we create a starter), or both when we
  # own the starter and productize it (and therefore need to release it and track the progress) but still need to get the
  # associated product version (e.g. OpenTracing)
